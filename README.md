# Design-of-a-Simple-General-Purpose-Processor
VHDL implementation of a simple processor with ALU, registers, FSM control unit, and 4x16 decoder on an FPGA (Cyclone-II DE2). Supports multiple arithmetic/logical operations, waveform simulation in Quartus II, and real-time output on seven-segment displays.
